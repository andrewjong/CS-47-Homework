Problem 3
a) Original:
tstart 679
tend 1216691
Avg. execution time: 0.000121601 msec

b) Using Registers:
tstart 631
tend 663540
Avg. execution time: 6.62909e-05 msec

c) Adding n:
tstart 967
tend 318760
Avg. execution time: 3.17793e-05 msec

d) Using registers can significantly speed up run time by several magnitudes
when used for reading/writing in memory, as can be seen with changing the type
of a and b. Using register values for operations that don't require read/write
with memory also speeds up execution time, as can be seen with n, but not nearly 
as much.

Problem 4
This program first prompts the user for extract mode or set mode.
The program then prompts the user for a number to manipulate.
The program asks for which bit index to use (0 being the LSB).
If the mode is extract, the program prints the value at the specified index.
Else if the mode is set, the program prints the new value of the number after the index is set to 1.
