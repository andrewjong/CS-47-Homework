a) Original:
tstart 679
tend 1216691
Avg. execution time: 0.000121601 msec

b) Using Registers:
tstart 631
tend 663540
Avg. execution time: 6.62909e-05 msec

c) Adding n:
tstart 967
tend 318760
Avg. execution time: 3.17793e-05 msec

d) Using registers can significantly speed up run time by several magnitudes
when used for reading/writing in memory, as can be seen with changing the type
of a and b. Using register values for operations that don't require read/write
with memory also speeds up execution time, as can be seen with n, but not nearly 
as much.
